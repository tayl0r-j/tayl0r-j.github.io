            <p>
              Completing my coursework in the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has helped me clarify both my 
              technical strengths and the professional standards I expect of myself as I transition into software engineering. 
              Across the program, I moved beyond isolated assignments toward designing, refining, and maintaining systems that evolve 
              over time. Building my capstone and its enhancements reinforced how deliberate design, clear communication, and disciplined 
              iteration combine to produce software that is reliable, secure, and maintainable. This process shaped my professional goals
              by grounding them in real development practices rather than theoretical outcomes.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Communication and Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
              Having spent the past eleven years training social workers and therapists, clear and intentional communication is one of my most defining 
              professional strengths. In that role, success depended on the ability to translate complex concepts into language that resonates with 
              clients, colleagues, and organizational stakeholders. This experience has given me a people-first communication style that is not always 
              common in software engineering, but is increasingly essential for building effective teams and delivering successful products. Years of practicing
              active listening, critical thinking, and adaptability have honed my ability to solve problems both collaboratively and creatively.      
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout my computer science coursework, I applied these communication skills in a technical context by documenting design decisions, 
              writing clear and purposeful narratives, and presenting my work in a professional manner. Whether through code comments, README files, 
              or formal technical reports, I focused on making my reasoning transparent and accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences. 
              This approach has allowed me to bridge gaps between technical implementation and real-world impact, ensuring that solutions are not only 
              well-engineered but also well-understood.
            </p>

            <h3>Software Engineering</h3>

            <p>
              Throughout the Computer Science program, I developed a strong foundation in software engineering by focusing on structure, maintainability, 
              and iterative improvement rather than simply producing working code. My coursework emphasized designing systems with clear separation of 
              concerns, layered architecture, and consistent conventions that support long-term maintainability.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my capstone project, I applied these principles by migrating a monolithic Python/Dash application to a well-architected Java Spring Boot 
              system. This transformation involved implementing RESTful APIs, service layers, and repository patterns that promote modularity and testability. 
              I prioritized writing clean, readable code. This experience reinforced the importance of thoughtful design and disciplined development practices in creating software that can evolve gracefully 
              over time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Enhancing an existing codebase reinforced the importance of disciplined iteration. Evaluating prior design decisions, refactoring safely, 
              and improving functionality without breaking existing behavior strengthened my ability to work within established systems and contribute 
              meaningfully to production-quality software.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>

            <p>
              My coursework strengthened my ability to select and apply appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve problems efficiently and intentionally. 
              ather than focusing on abstract implementations alone, I learned to evaluate trade-offs such as time complexity, space usage, and readability when 
              designing solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through applied projects and enhancement work, I implemented and optimized sorting, searching, and collection-based operations using lists, maps, and 
              custom data structures. These experiences reinforced how algorithmic choices directly impact performance and scalability, particularly as data size and 
              application complexity increase.
            </p>

            <p>
              By revisiting and improving existing implementations, I developed a deeper understanding of algorithmic efficiency and refactoring. This process improved 
              my ability to reason about performance, justify technical decisions, and write code that balances efficiency with maintainability in real-world scenarios.
            </p>

            <h3>Database</h3>

            <p>
              Throughout the Computer Science program, I developed practical experience designing and integrating databases within full-stack applications. Rather than treating 
              data persistence as an isolated concern, I learned to model data in a way that supports application logic, scalability, and long-term maintainability.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my capstone project, I implemented a relational database using PostgreSQL and integrated it with the application through JPA and Hibernate. This work 
              involved defining entity relationships, managing schema evolution, and writing queries that efficiently supported application features. I gained hands-on 
              experience configuring database connections, mapping objects to relational structures, and ensuring data consistency across the system.
            </p>

            <p> 
              Enhancing the application to use a persistent database reinforced the importance of thoughtful schema design and clean separation between business logic 
              and data access. These experiences strengthened my ability to work with production-style databases and prepared me to design data-driven systems that are 
              both reliable and adaptable.
            </p>

            <h3>Security</h3>

            <p>
              Throughout the Computer Science program, I developed an understanding of security as a foundational concern rather than an afterthought. My coursework 
              emphasized secure coding practices, proper configuration management, and awareness of common risks such as exposing sensitive data or tightly coupling 
              credentials to source code.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my capstone project, I applied these principles by separating sensitive configuration values from the codebase and managing them through environment 
              variables. This approach reduced the risk of credential exposure and aligned the application with real-world security practices used in professional 
              environments. I also implemented structured error handling and validation to ensure predictable behavior and prevent unintended data exposure. In this project,
              I took specific precautions to safeguard against XSS and SQL Injection attacks by validating inputs and using parameterized queries.
            </p>

            <p>By incorporating security considerations into both design and implementation, I learned to balance functionality with risk mitigation. These 
              experiences strengthened my ability to build software that is not only functional and maintainable, but also mindful of security, reliability, and 
              responsible data handling.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Python/Dash Dog Shelter Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
          The original artifact was a data visualization dashboard built with Python, Dash, and Plotly. It was designed 
          to help animal shelter staff track and manage dog intake, adoption rates, and shelter capacity. The application 
          featured interactive charts, filtering capabilities, and basic CRUD operations connected to a MongoDB database.

      <h2>Enhancements & Domain Pivot</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Transformation: From Dog Dashboard to Raid Tool Command Center</h3>
        <p>
          Rather than making incremental refinements to the original Python/Dash application, 
          I made a deliberate decision to re-design the system and pivot it to a domain I understand deeply: raid management for 
          WoW: Classic. This shift allowed me to approach the project from a true stakeholder perspective while preserving and 
          strengthening the core computer science objectives of the capstone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enhanced system was rebuilt as a full-stack Java Spring Boot application backed by a normalized PostgreSQL database. 
          I introduced a relational data model to represent raid teams and members, implemented JPA repositories and service-layer 
          logic to enforce data integrity, and exposed RESTful endpoints to support reliable CRUD operations and sorted roster 
          retrieval. These enhancements significantly improved data consistency, query performance, and overall maintainability 
          compared to the original implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This domain pivot enabled me to demonstrate the same foundational skills required by the original artifact in a context
          where I could reason like an end user and system owner. The result is a more meaningful, production-oriented artifact that 
          reflects not only technical proficiency, but also thoughtful system design, stakeholder awareness, and professional software 
          engineering practice.
